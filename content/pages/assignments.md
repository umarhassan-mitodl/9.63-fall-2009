Description of Assignments
--------------------------

### Issue Spotter Exercises

We will do a few "issue spotter" exercises in class whenever relevant. These exercises consist of a critic of an experimental design and the results. Issue spotters will be distributed in class and you can work on them in groups. They will count towards "participation" grade.

### CogLab Assignments

You choose 4 CogLab experiments among the 5 CogLab experiments that we propose. These are short (5 to 15 min) experiments.

*   Perform 4 CogLab experiments (2-3 pages each)
*   1 Science newspaper article on your project

The CogLab procedure consists of running the experiment on a Mac or PC and saving the data in html or excel. After receiving the group data, do a statistical analysis and write a 2-3 page report. If you are a CogLab presenter, prepare a 10 min. talk. The summary consists of a 2-3 page word document that includes:

*   A title describing the CogLab research topic
*   A short abstract (~150 words maximum)
*   Introduction
*   Hypothesis
*   Experimental method
*   Result: Add a table or a graph
*   Statistical analysis
*   Interpretation of your result
*   Conclusion
*   References

Written Assignments
-------------------

*   Paper 1 (~ 2500 words)—A literature review based on about 10 articles. The review is related to your project topic and helps you define an original research question.
*   Paper 2 (~ 2500 words)—One experiment (Experiment 1), often single-factor design with controls. A report on Experiment 1 will constitute the basis of a research report.
*   Paper 3 (~ 4500 words)—One experiment (Experiment 2), often two-factors with controls (related to Project 2). Experiment 2 (and a summary of Experiment 1 when relevant) will constitute the basis of the final research paper.

Note: All research projects are done in groups of 1-3 students. All papers are written individually.

Oral Presentations
------------------

Oral presentations consist of class participation, 1 CogLab experiment and 3 talks.
